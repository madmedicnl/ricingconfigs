# ricingconfigs
A repository where I save the configs I use for my ricing adventures

  
The will be categorized by theme and than in dirs where i keep the config files... base directory is ~ (or User home)
All files are used in windows and I guarantee they only work in windows.

  
If you want to theme/rice you windows you need a few things:
THe following apps:  

  
[7TSP GUI 2019 Edition](https://www.deviantart.com/devillnside/art/7TSP-GUI-2019-Edition-804769422)  

[SecureUXTheme](https://github.com/namazso/SecureUxTheme)  

[StartAllBack](https://www.startallback.com/) note: this is shareware as in free for a period but than it requires you to buy it.  


I advice you to use the apps in the order as I mentioned them.
And after the last reboot do just one more reboot and you're set.

  
I know there are magnificent tools like Windhawk and such but I'm an old fox who has hard times changing habits.

  
In my basic install I always use:  

-[Terminal preview](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)
-[Powershell preview](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)
-[Midnight Commander](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcwin32/)
-[Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
-[LF](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) 
-[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
-[PSFzf](https://github.com/kelleyma49/PSFzf) please read the readme here for optimal use
-[Bottom, a system monitor in terminal](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom)
-[Oh my Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)
-[Komorebi](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi)
-[Flow Launcher](https://www.flowlauncher.com/), make sure after you install everything to change the options in the plugin Explorer settings to Everything you'll never want to live without it again on your computer.
